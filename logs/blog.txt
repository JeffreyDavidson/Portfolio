Today I worked on catching up on my previous week's assignments. I took the day off of work to focus on my education and my portfolio. In working on my assignments I have completed all work from Week 2 and have placed myself in a position for success for Week 3. I have completed my anchor points, worked on my Trello list called Project Back Log, updated my mission statement and decided what concepts to I was going to target this week. I spent some time doing research on laravel.com in regards to a current on-going project. This will help me when I start working on unit testing as a concept for this week.
