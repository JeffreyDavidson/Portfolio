## About Me

My strengths as a web developer are shown in my abilities with the PHP and MySQL languages. I have worked with these languages since 2000 and I have kept up with their continuous versions. In the language of PHP I have dabbled in the frameworks of CodeIgniter and I am currently developing with the Laravel framework. I have a love for working with MySQL databases and structuring how data is stored and tables are normalized inside those databases. I am working toward my increase in productivity with testing environments and deploying projects to live servers.

I am challenging myself to become a well rounded developer by improving my skills in all aspects of web design and development. This includes both back-end concepts, languages, frameworks, and front-end user experience design and user interface design. I research these concepts by being a part of the [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com), [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), [Tuts Plus](http://tutsplus.com), and [Lynda](http://lynda.com) communities. This includes watching videos, being apart of discussion boards by asking and answering other developer's questions. I would also like to expand my knowledge by traveling to conferences when possible and to learn from experts in the field.

## Objective
My goal is to put together a portfolio of works that showcases my work as a web developer. I work with an eye for detail ensuring that code is well documented as well as errors are properly found and corrected. As a loyal and hard working candidate I can promise to produce results within a desired timeline. I will communicate status updates with you and other project team members. As the world of web development continues to grow I challenge myself to read upon and learn new facets in our industry and always seek have continuous learning through my entire career.
