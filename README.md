# Project Accomplishments for Jeffrey Davidson

To persevere through the many struggles to produce quality samplings of my acquired knowledge. Take time to learn more concepts and be more detailed in the concepts I already have a working knowledge of.

My strengths as a web developer are shown in my abilities with the PHP and MySQL languages. I have worked with these languages since 2000 and I have kept up with their continuous versions.  In the language of PHP I have dabbled in the frameworks of CodeIgniter and I am currently developing with the Laravel framework. I have a love for working with MySQL databases and structuring how data is stored and tables are normalized inside those databases. I am working toward my increase in productivity with testing environments and deploying projects to live servers. I am challenging myself to become a well rounded developer by improving my skills in the design and the frontend aspects of web development.

As a web developer I work with an eye for detail ensuring that code is well documented as well as errors are properly found and corrected. As a loyal and hard working candidate I can promise to produce results within a desired timeline. I will communicate status updates with you and other project team members. As the world of web development continues to grow I challenge myself to read upon and learn new facets in our industry and always seek have continuous learning through my entire career.
